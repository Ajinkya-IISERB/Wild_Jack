UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

Expressed in cotyledons and leaves. Mutants display de-etiolation and derepression of light-induced genes in the dark, dwarfism, male sterility and activation of stress-regulated genes in the light. The expression of the gene using a CPD promoter:LUC fusion construct was shown to be under circadian and light control. Additionally, the circadian regulation was shown to be independent of BR levels as it remains unchanged in <i>bri1</i> mutant lines. CPD appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through a BRI1-mediated signaling pathway that affects FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses.

AT5G23150	locus:2178292	HUA2	ENHANCER OF AG-4 2	7249	Chr5	7785743	7792991	A. thaliana	Tudor/PWWP/MBT domain-containing protein;(source:Araport11)	Putative transcription factor. Member of the floral homeotic AGAMOUS pathway.Mutations in HUA enhance the phenotype of mild ag-4 allele. Single hua mutants are early flowering and have  reduced levels of FLC mRNA. Other MADS box flowering time genes such as FLM and MAF2 also appear to be regulated by HUA2. HUA2 normally activates FLC expression and enhances  AG function. HUA and HUA-LIKE (HULK) genes act redundantly to regulate a subset of essential genes, with some (or all) family members also having specific functions. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
